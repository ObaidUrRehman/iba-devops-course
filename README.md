Forked my teacher's lecture repository to have a local copy of all lectures and code files, and was having some trouble
understanding some of the code, thought other people might have this difficulty as well, so commented heavily in each code file (yaml or tf) relating to docker,
docker-compose, k8 manifests, and terreform IaC configurations files.

You're welcome :)
